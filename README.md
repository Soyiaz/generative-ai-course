## 📚 Course Overview

This is an 8-week intensive course for intermediate/advanced students to gain hands-on experience with:
- Building and deploying generative agents
- Fine-tuning foundation models (LLMs, diffusion)
- Working with multimodal AI (text, image, audio, video)
- Hosting models as APIs and serving them for web and mobile front ends
- Automating model workflows using GitHub Actions, Docker, and APIs
- **Modern Development Practices**: CI/CD, testing, security, collaboration

Each week includes 3 hours of lectures and 3 hours of practical workshops.

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

This project implements a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline that demonstrates real-world development practices:

### Pipeline Stages
1. **Quality Check**: Linting, formatting, type checking
2. **Testing**: Unit and integration tests across Python versions
3. **Security**: Vulnerability scanning with Bandit and Safety
4. **Student Validation**: Automated feedback for submissions
5. **Build**: Docker image creation
6. **Deploy**: Staging and production deployment

### Branch Strategy
- **`main`**: Production-ready code (admin only)
- **`develop`**: Integration branch for contributors
- **`intern/*`**: Personal branches for interns
- **`feature/*`**: Feature development branches
- **`hotfix/*`**: Emergency fixes

### Automated Checks
- ✅ Code formatting (Black)
- ✅ Style checking (Flake8)
- ✅ Type checking (MyPy)
- ✅ Security scanning (Bandit, Safety)
- ✅ Test coverage (Pytest)
- ✅ Student submission validation
