## ❌ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Don't Do This
- Submit work outside the `student-submissions/` folder
- Create feature branches (work directly on main)
- Forget to include README.md
- Submit incomplete or non-functional code
- Include API keys or sensitive data
- Use unclear commit messages

### ✅ Do This Instead
- Put all work in `student-submissions/your-username/week-X/`
- Work directly on your fork's main branch
- Include comprehensive documentation
- Test your code before submitting
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Write descriptive commit messages

## 🔧 Development Tools

### Code Quality Tools
```bash
# Format your code
black student-submissions/your-username/week-X/

# Check for style issues
flake8 student-submissions/your-username/week-X/

# Run type checking
mypy student-submissions/your-username/week-X/

# Security check
bandit -r student-submissions/your-username/week-X/
```

### Testing Your Code
```bash
# Run your code
python student-submissions/your-username/week-X/assignment.py

# Test with different inputs
python -c "import sys; sys.path.append('.'); from student_submissions.your_username.week_X import assignment; print('Tests passed!')"
