## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to avoid potential exploitation.

### 2. Report the vulnerability
Send an email to: [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com)

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

### 3. Response timeline
- **Initial response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status update**: Within 1 week
- **Resolution**: As soon as possible, typically within 30 days

### 4. Disclosure
Once the vulnerability is fixed, we will:
- Release a security patch
- Update the changelog
- Credit the reporter (if desired)

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors
- Never commit sensitive information (API keys, passwords, etc.)
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Follow secure coding practices
- Keep dependencies updated
- Review code for security issues

### For Students
- Never include API keys or credentials in your submissions
- Use placeholder values for sensitive data
- Follow the course's security guidelines
- Report any security concerns to instructors

### For Administrators
- Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities
- Monitor for suspicious activity
- Keep all systems updated
- Implement proper access controls

## Security Tools

This project uses several security tools:

### Automated Security Checks
- **Bandit**: Python security linter
- **Safety**: Dependency vulnerability scanner
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Automated vulnerability detection

### Manual Security Reviews
- Code review process includes security considerations
- Regular security audits of the codebase
- Dependency vulnerability assessments

## Security Configuration

### Environment Variables
Never commit these to version control:
```bash
# API Keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here

# Database credentials
DB_PASSWORD=your_password_here

# Other sensitive data
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_here
```

### Secure File Handling
- Use `.env` files for local development
- Use GitHub Secrets for CI/CD
- Use secure storage for production credentials

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Process
1. **Detection**: Identify and confirm the security incident
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate the scope and impact
3. **Containment**: Prevent further damage
4. **Eradication**: Remove the threat
5. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
6. **Lessons Learned**: Document and improve
